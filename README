TODO:
 1. After first successful communication session (on client side)
    can not be opened again on the same socket. (In other words when server
    is re-launched a newly started client can't access it.)

 2. Test on real RTSP/RTP ports number. Test on reasl multicast addresses.

 3. Provide references to results of "configure" within "Makefile.in".

 4. Parse the commandline parameters with getopt, otherwise remove the last
    one from "configure.in".

HOW TO USE:

 1. Start "traffic_emitter" on first IPv6-network PC (this one will be
    SERVER PC).

 2. Start "traffic_receiver IPV6_ADDR*" on second IPv6-network PC (this one
    will be CLIENT PC), input characters as long as being promted, and observe
    the console output - reponce characters generater and sent frmo SERVER PC.

(*) - IPv6 address of PC with "traffic_emitter" started on.
